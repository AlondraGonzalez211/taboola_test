/* Suggestions: 1. Editing the Node class to take out int num and replace it with a variable to get data and having this.data = data
                2. Change interface to take in the data type you want
                3. There can be a method to change the string into the datatype you want, maybe adding something to check what type you're working with
                4. Modify the main method accordingly to the datatype you want
                5. update serialize and deserialize methods to the chosen datatype
